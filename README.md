## Introduction

I attended Pasadena City College from Fall 2017 to Spring 2019. At this time, I programmed using C++, Java, and Python, depending on the course. 

I transferred to University of California, Los Angeles in Fall 2019, and graduated in Spring 2021 with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics. Matlab, C+++, and Python were used often in the Math and Computer Science courses taken here. 

I attended University of California, Davis starting Fall 2021, graduating with a M.S. in Statistics after the Fall 2022 quarter. My courses at UC Davis aligned with the program's Data Science Track, emphasizing a curriculum in the foundational math and statistics behind machine learning models. Here I began using R as a primary programming language to calculate statistics and conduct statistcal analysis. For machine learning related topics, Python was the preferred language.
