## Introduction

I attended Pasadena City College from Fall 2017 to Spring 2019.

I transfered to University of California, Los Angeles in Fall 2019, and graduated in Spring 2021 with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics. 

I attended University of California, Davis starting Fall 2021, graduating with a M.S. in Statistics after the Fall 2022 quarter. My courses at UC Davis aligned with the program's respective Data Science Track.
